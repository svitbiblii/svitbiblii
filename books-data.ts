        "title": "Heretics",
        "anotation": "Heretics by G. K. Chesterton is a critical examination and philosophical treatise written in the early 20th century. The book addresses the moral and intellectual confusion of modern society, particularly the shifting definitions and attitudes toward orthodoxy and heresy. Chesterton critiques prominent figures of his time, such as Rudyard Kipling and H.G. Wells, as he explores the erosion of philosophical thought and the significance of fundamental beliefs in literature and politics. At the start of Heretics, Chesterton lays the groundwork for his arguments by contrasting the ancient notions of heresy and orthodoxy with contemporary perspectives. He observes that what was once considered honorable—standing firm in one's beliefs against the crowd—has become inverted; now, the term heretic is often worn as a badge of pride by those who release themselves from conventional truths. Chesterton discusses the dangers of abandoning overarching ideals, claiming that society is losing sight of the broader questions of existence, morality, and philosophy in favor of ephemeral details. The opening portions introduce his intention to confront various notable thinkers, positioning them as representatives of flawed philosophies that neglect the essential truths of human experience.",

The beginning of Orthodoxy sets the stage for Chesterton's journey of self-discovery as he contemplates his philosophical position. He recounts the influence of prior critics and emphasizes the importance of providing an explanation for his faith. He uses a vivid metaphor of a man discovering England, implying that his philosophical journey mirrors a realization of pre-existing truths. Chesterton argues against the modern tendency to deny fundamental human experiences, such as the existence of sin, while asserting the need for a romantic view of the world that combines wonder with a sense of belonging.
